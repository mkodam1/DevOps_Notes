Introduction to Linux---Its a Open Source Operating System modelled on Unix and developed in C, which can be downloaded and customised.
Companies using Linux:
Facebook platform is built on modified version of CentOS. CentOS is Noncommercial, while Red Hat is commercial( money for support). 
Red Hat comes with proprietary software packages and enterprise support.
Dream Works----Uses linux for security, reduce cost, increase efficiency.
Google----goobunta(customized linux distribution)
Munich---LiMux(customized linux distribution)
NASA

Open Source: A S/W becomes open source if its source code is freely available. Anyone can download, modify.
Closed Source: Propritery software(Microsoft,Adobe)

Linux Vs Unix
Cost--Linux is free whereas Unix is not free.
Flexibility--Linux is flexible whereas Unix is not flexible(compatible with lesser hardware).
Source code-Available whereas not available in Unix(as its not a freeware)
Installation-Economical whereas in Unix its uneconomical(Unix requires specific hardware).
Community-wide network of developers whereas Unix has limited commercial developers.
Support-Depends on forums and community for support in Linux whereas vendors provide technical support for commercial Unix.  
Bug Fixes-Bug Fixing is faster in linux than in Unix.

Features of Linux: It is Reliable( no need to Reboot repeatedly), Support(Huge base of developers), Monitory cost is less, It is Open Source,
Licensing freedom(reuse and republish the code), customized,  enhancements are frequent, very Secure OS.

Where Linux is used-----Servers, embedded systems, android, NASA, Supercomputers, Gaming and Visual effect servers.

Components of Linux OS: Init Program---the 1st program which is responsible for the initialization of the system. Ex:sysvinit, systemd
Bootloader--Program which loads the OS when system is turned on. Ex: GNU Grub, Grub2,Syslinux
Software Libraries--Set of programming code used to develop and design software programs.(dynamic link libraries----dll)
Package Management System--A collection of tools for Installation, deletion, configuration and upgradation of software. RHL8---RPM, dpkg.
Other Interface and Applications: various applications and interfaces are used for various tasks performed by user.

Architecture of Linux OS: Application, Shell, Kernel and Hardware.
Application:Executes the utllity commands.
Shell:It is an Interface/Interpretere to Kernel(hides the complexities to user).Takes the command in Human language and gives to kernel in binary language.
Kernel:It consists of core components of O/S, which operate with the hardware and provide low level services to upper layers.
Hardware-It consists of all the Pheripherals.

Types of Shell:Bash,C Shell, korn shell, tsch shell
Bash-Bourne Again Shell was written to enhance the functionality of sh(Bourne-Shell)
First line in Shell Scripting-#!/bin/bash-This command tells linux to run with bash interpreter.

What is Linux Distribution: It is an OS having Linux Kernel and GNU tools packed with some more applications.
1. Ubuntu 2.Debian 3.Red Hat Linux 4.Fedora 5.CentOS
Ubuntu is very popular as it is easy to use, secure,reliable, multi-variant releases. Ex:Desktop,Server.

Types of Files in Linux: File, Run Level, Pipe
File-In linux everything is a file(Ex:Files, directories,socket,links etc)
'-' means its a normal file
'd' means its a normal directory
'l' means symbolic link (shortcut to file/directory)
's' means sockect(pass the data between two Processes)
'p' means its a pipe(similar to socket, but users cannot work with it directly)
'c' Processes character hardware communication

Run Levels: The init figures out the default run-level to start the associated script w.r.t the configured run level.
 we can manually change the run level using the telinit command and superuser has permission to modify the run-level.
 It is an operational level which describes the current state of the system w.r.t the services available.
 It is a single digit integer that defines the state of the system.
 a. '0'-Halt the system.
 b. '1'-Single user mode
 c. '2'-Multiple user mode with no network File System.
 d. '3'-Multiple user mode in CLI but no GUI.
 e. '4'-User definable
 f. '5'-Multiple user mode in GUI
 g. '6'-Reboot

Pipe: Pipe('|') is used to direct the output of one command to another.
 Creates an internal connection between 2 or more commands.
 Data is passed to other commands directly instead of using temporary text files. 
 The Pipe is unidirectional and data flows from left to right.
 Pipe along with grep is most commonly used Ex: cat fil.txt | grep "Linux"
 
Commands:
a.echo "Display message"--------------(echo is used to display messages on screen).
   output: Display message
    
 b. echo $SHELL----------------to know which type of shell is available in this linux.
    output: /bin/bash
    
 c. There are 4 types of cat commands:
   1.To create a File
      cat ><File1.txt>---------------This command will create a File File1.txt and will open it to write information.
      Ex: cat >F1.txt
      Pressing ctrl + d will deny the next line.
    2. To add to a file
       cat >><File1.txt>-------------This command will add more data to the existing line. To append data this command is used.
       Doesn't work in interactive mode.
    3. To view a file
       cat/etc/shell2----------------------to view the contents of a file without going inside the file. Here all the contents of shell2 are displayed.
        cat 'Filename'-------------------here the contents of Filename are displayed.
        cat file.txt | grep “Linux”----------view the contents & fetching the word “Linux”.
    4. To overwrite a file
       create one two more File2.txt and File3.txt Add some data.
       cat File1.txt File2.txt >File3.txt-----The contents of file(File3.txt) will be over written with files(File1.txt and File2.txt).
       
 e. clear-----------------clears the screen  or (ctrl+l)  or 
    alias  c=clear
    c
  f. ls------------------lists all the files and directories but without colour coding we cannot make out if its a file or directory.
 
 g. ls -l---------------lists all properties of its files and folders like permissions, size, timestamp etc.
Here ‘–‘ at the begining of the line indicates that it is a File. ‘d’ at the begining of the line indicates that it is a directory. ‘l’ at the begining of the line indicates that it is a linked file. 
 h. ls -l | grep "^-"--------------to view only files from all the files and directories.
   ls -l | grep "^d"--------------to view only directories from all the files and directories.
  i. touch file1---------------------creates an empty file(file1)  
  j. touch file(1,2,3)---------------creates multiple empty files in a single command with extension .txt.
  k. #!/bin/bash--------------------first line in shell scripting. 
  l. whoami--------------------------used to know current logged in user.
$--------------For regular user this prompt is displayed with limited privileges
#--------------For super user this prompt is displayed with all privileges
m. pwd-----------------------present(print) working directory or to know what directory we are working with.
n. mkdir dir1-----------------to create a directory
  mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3------to create multiple directories.
  mkdir –p india/telengana/hyd----------------to create nested directories, where ‘p’ is parent directory.
o. $ sudo su - (To change from a normal user to super user).
p. exit --------(To change from a super user to normal user).
q. To change password: $ sudo su -
                       # password edureka(edureka is user name)
                       Enter new UNIX password:
                       Retype new UNIX password:
                       passwd:password updated successfully
